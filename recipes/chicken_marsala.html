        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>One of my favorite dishes to order when visiting an Italian restaurant is Chicken Marsala. The umami flavor from the mushrooms is perfectly complemented by the tanginess
                of the marsala wine which culminates in a truly memorable dining experience. Serve with some pasta and you have an excellent dish to share with family and friends on any occasion.</p>
