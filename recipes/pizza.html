        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>If you're one of the billions of people living outside the country of Italy, you might be limited in the quality and/or quantity of local pizzerias to choose from.
            Fortunately, your craving for an authentic Italian style pizza can easily be fed through the Ooni oven which brings the brick oven to your backyard. No longer do
            you need to worry about stomaching another sloppy slice of Papa John's as you can create a pie that rivals those native to Bel Paese.</p>
            <p>If that alone doesn't make your mouth water, once you read through this recipe for a Burrata pizza, you'll be sorry to have spent years without having made one.
            Burrata is an Italian cow milk cheese with an outer casing of solid cheese and an inside of stracciatella and cream. Decorate your delicious burrata pizza with
            proschiutto and basil and dig in to one of life's greatest eats.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <p>Makes 1 x 12"/16" pizza</p>
            <ul>
            <li>8.8/11.6oz (250/330g) classic pizza dough</li>
            <li>5 tbsp (90ml) pizza sauce (see note below)</li>
            <li>2-3 slices prosciutto</li>
            <li>9oz (150g) burrata</li>
            <li>Handful small basil leaves</li>
            <li>2 tbsp (40ml) extra virgin olive oil</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
            <li>Prepare your pizza dough ahead of time. Our guide to making the perfect Classic Pizza Dough covers everything you need to know.</li>    
            <li>For the sauce for this pizza, we recommend preparing our easy Classic Pizza Sauce. With a hint of garlic, salt and basil, it's the ideal pizza sauce that will help to bring out the flavors in the other ingredients used here.</li>
            <li>Once your dough and sauce are ready, fire up your Ooni pizza oven. Aim for approximately 950˚F (500˚C) on the stone baking board inside. You can check the temperature inside your Ooni quickly and easily using the Ooni Infrared Thermometer.</li>
            <li>Take the burrata out of the fridge so that it warms up to room temperature. The burrata isn’t cooked in the oven on top of the pizza, but added to the pizza once it’s cooked, so it’s important that it’s not super cold.</li>
            <li>Stretch the pizza dough ball out to 12”/16” and lay it out on your Ooni pizza peel. Using a large spoon or ladle, spread the sauce evenly across the pizza dough base. Slide the pizza off the peel and into your Ooni, making sure to rotate the pizza regularly.</li>
            <li>Once cooked, remove the pizza from the oven. Lay the prosciutto on top, then the burrata, scatter over the basil and finish with a generous drizzle of extra virgin olive oil.</li>
